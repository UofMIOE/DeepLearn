%Short Recurrent Neural Network - Draft

% Solve an Autoregression Problem with External Input with a NARX Neural
% Network
% This script assumes these variables are defined:
%
%   ESTIMATED_MILEAGE - input time series.
%   PURCHASE_EVENT - feedback time series.
%   

X = tonndata(ESTIMATED_MILEAGE,false,false);
T = tonndata(PURCHASE_EVENT,false,false);

% Choose a Training Function
trainFcn = 'trainlm';  % Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation.

% Create a Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with External Input
inputDelays = 1:2;
feedbackDelays = 1:2;
hiddenLayerSize = 10;
net = narxnet(inputDelays,feedbackDelays,hiddenLayerSize,'open',trainFcn);

% Prepare the Data for Training and Simulation
% The function PREPARETS prepares timeseries data for a particular network,
% shifting time by the minimum amount to fill input states and layer
% states. Using PREPARETS allows you to keep your original time series data
% unchanged, while easily customizing it for networks with differing
% numbers of delays, with open loop or closed loop feedback modes.
[x,xi,ai,t] = preparets(net,X,{},T);

% Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100; %Can change to necessary size
net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100; %can change to necessary size
net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100; %can change to necessary size

% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,x,t,xi,ai);

% Test the Network
y = net(x,xi,ai);
e = gsubtract(t,y);
performance = perform(net,t,y)

% View the Network
view(net)

% Closed Loop Network
% Use this network to do multi-step prediction.
% The function CLOSELOOP replaces the feedback input with a direct
% connection from the outout layer.
netc = closeloop(net);
netc.name = [net.name ' - Closed Loop'];
view(netc)
[xc,xic,aic,tc] = preparets(netc,X,{},T);
yc = netc(xc,xic,aic);
closedLoopPerformance = perform(net,tc,yc)

% Step-Ahead Prediction Network
% For some applications it helps to get the prediction a timestep early.
% The original network returns predicted y(t+1) at the same time it is
% given y(t+1). For some applications such as decision making, it would
% help to have predicted y(t+1) once y(t) is available, but before the
% actual y(t+1) occurs. The network can be made to return its output a
% timestep early by removing one delay so that its minimal tap delay is now
% 0 instead of 1. The new network returns the same outputs as the original
% network, but outputs are shifted left one timestep.
nets = removedelay(net);
nets.name = [net.name ' - Predict One Step Ahead'];
view(nets)
[xs,xis,ais,ts] = preparets(nets,X,{},T);
ys = nets(xs,xis,ais);
stepAheadPerformance = perform(nets,ts,ys)
